      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'

      text: |-
        I am a research scientist specializing in deep learning applications for cybersecurity and smart agriculture. My work focuses on designing efficient, lightweight, and real-time AI models for UAV-based plant disease detection, intrusion detection systems, and cyber-attack prevention.

        Through a series of recent publications - including EF-CenterNet, MobileH-Transformer, TinyResViT, DetectVul, and XSShield - I aim to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI models and practical deployment in resource-constrained environments such as IoT and edge devices.

        I leverage both quantitative and qualitative approaches to explore how artificial intelligence can enhance sustainability, security, and performance in real-world systems. Iâ€™m always open to collaborationâ€”feel free to connect!
